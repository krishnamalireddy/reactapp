If you're editing images, there's nothing on Linux that matches its enormous toolkit.\n\nHowever, it is in serious need of a usability overhaul. The user interface felt thrown together in 1999 when I first started using it, and it's not changed substantially since, except for the addition of the MDI mode which is only partially successful in its goals of making GIMP more Photoshop-like. Menu layout and behaviour of the toolboxes is still more or less exactly the same as it was 20 years ago. You get used to it, but when you come back to it from another app, you realise how dated and clunky it feels. The same is true of many of the tools themselves, where there's a tale of a thousand tiny usability papercuts: none of them important on their own, all of them liveable with, but there's just so many of them. The number of times I've found myself accidentally painting on the wrong layer and had to undo, then redo... and yet I don't find myself doing it much at all in Photoshop or Krita, both of which have otherwise very similar layer systems to GIMP.\n\nIf you're not invested in GIMP already, consider starting with Krita, which has a slightly narrower toolkit for photo editing, but has all the basics, a much nicer workflow and UI, and a heap of professional painterly features that GIMP doesn't.",
