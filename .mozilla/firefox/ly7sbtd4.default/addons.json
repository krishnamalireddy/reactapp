What you search for is your own business, which is why DuckDuckGo search doesn't track you. Ever.\n    Decode Privacy Policies — We’ve partnered with Terms of Service Didn't Read to include their scores and labels of website terms of service and privacy policies, where available. \n\n\nOur add-on also adds a toolbar icon that shows you a Privacy Grade rating when you visit a website (A-F). This rating lets you see how protected you are at a glance, dig into the details to see who we caught trying to track you, and learn how we enhanced the underlying site's privacy measures. The Privacy Grade is scored automatically based on the prevalence of hidden tracker networks, encryption availability, and website privacy practices.\n\nToo many people believe you simply can’t expect privacy on the Internet.

Give it a try!","fullDescription":"➤ How it works\n\nEcosia is a search engine like Google, but very different: we use our ad revenue to plant trees where nature and people need them most. The Ecosia community has already planted millions of trees in Ethiopia, Brazil, Indonesia, Spain, as well as many other biodiversity hotspots.\n\n➤ Privacy, not just promises\n\nWe're interested in trees, not your data: we don’t save your searches, we don’t track the websites you visit, we don’t sell your data to advertisers, and your searches are always SSL-encrypted.\n\n➤ CO2 positive\n\nCO2 neutral is not enough. Thanks to our solar plant and the Ecosia forests around the world, each of your searches removes around 1 kg of CO2 from the atmosphere.\n\n➤ Radical transparency\n\nTrust has to be earned. That’s why we publish our monthly financial reports and tree-planting receipts on our website. We also signed a legal contract that requires us to stay true to our not-for-profit cause, forever.\n\n♡ Get the Firefox Add-on today.
